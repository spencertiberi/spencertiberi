# "Let's go underneath the hood"

Here's a video from CS50's own Tommy MacWilliam '13 teaching a section on computer hardware. The section you should watch is about 26 minutes long, but always feel free to change the video speed (pro tip!).

Here are notes on Tommy's section:

Once comfortable with the above, let's move on to some questions, shall we?

## Mother, I'm bored.
1\. Below is a motherboard with 7 unlabeled parts (lettered A–G, to be clear). For each of these letters, tell us:<br>
  i. What the component is called <br>
  ii. What the component is used for (e.g., what devices plug into it)<br>

2\. In a succinct but technically detailed paragraph, what happens when you turn on your computer?

## Windows Explorer
3\. Time for some exploring! Let’s get to know your computer a little better. Tell us the following about the computer you have at home: <br>
i. Brand and model <br>
ii. Hard drive capacity <br>
iii. Amount of RAM <br>
iv. Model and speed of CPU <br>
v. Display resolution and size <br>
vi. Operating system

4\. More exploring! Dora would be proud. Now, take a look at the various ports on your computer. If on a laptop, your ports are probably located around the perimeter of the bottom half of your computer. If on a desktop, ports are probably located in the back of the tower, and perhaps a few can be found on the front. For each of your computer’s ports, give us a picture or
sketch as well as a description of what the port is called and what can plug into it.
